## 1. Get this SDK
by downloading the most recent version here: https://github.com/adeven/adjust_sdk/tags

## 2. Add it to your project
by dragging the AdjustIo directory into the "Supporting Files" group in your Xcode project navigator (or any other group of your choice). A dialog box appears for you to "choose options for adding these files". Make sure the checkbox is checked and the upper radio button is selected before you finish.

## 3. Integrate AdjustIo into your app
by adding some code to your AppDelegate.m file. 
* Import the SDK by adding the line `#import "AdjustIo.h"` at the top of the file. 
* Start AdjustIo by adding the line `[AdjustIo appDidLaunch:@"<appId>"];` to your `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` or your `applicationDidFinishLaunching:` method's body. 
* replace `<appId>` with the Apple ID that is provided by iTunes Connect for your app (Log into iTunes Connect, select "Manage Your Applications", select your app, see the "Apple ID" entry in the App Infomration tab).
* If you want to track the deviceId, add the line `[AdjustIo trackDeviceId];` as well.

## 4. Build your app
* If the build succeeds, you successfully integrated AjdustIo into your app.
* If your project was already using AFNetworking, your build failed because of many duplicate symbols. Just remove the AdjustIO/AFNetworking group to fix this issue.
* If your project uses automatic reference counting, your build failed because of many ARC restriction errors. Fix this by disabling ARC on all AdjustIo files in the target's Build Phases: Expand the "Compile Sources" group, select all AdjustIo files (AjustIo, AI..., ...+AIAdditions, AF..., ...+AFNetworking) and change the "Compilec Flags" to `-fno-objc-arc` (press the return key to change all at once).
