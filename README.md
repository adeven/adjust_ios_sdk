## Summary

This is the iOS SDK of AdjustIo. You can read more about AdjustIo at
[adjust.io].

## Basic Installation

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the AdjustIo SDK into your
iOS project. We are going to assume that you use Xcode for your iOS
development.

### 1. Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Extract the
archive in a folder of your choice.

### 2. Add it to your project

In Xcode's Project Navigator locate the `Supporting Files` group (or any other
group of your choice). From Finder drag the `AdjustIo` subdirectory into
Xcode's `Supporting Files` group.

![][drag]

In the dialog `Choose options for adding these files` make sure to check the
checkbox to `Copy items into destination group's folder` and select the upper
radio button to `Create groups for any added folders`.

![][add]

### 3. Add the AdSupport framework

In the Project Navigator select your project. In the left hand side of the main
view select your target. In the tab `Build Phases` expand the group `Link
Binary with Libraries`. On the bottom of that group click on the `+` button.
Select the `AdSupport.framework` and click the `Add` button. In the list of
frameworks select the newly added `AdSupport.framework` and change the
attribute `Required` to `Optional`.

![][framework]

### 4. Integrate AdjustIo into your app

In the Project Navigator open the source file your Application Delegate. Add
the `import` statement at the top of the file. In the `didFinishLaunching` or
`didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method of your App Delegate call the method
`appDidLaunch`. Replace `{YourAppToken}` with the App Token that you can find
in your [dashboard].

```objc
#import "AdjustIo.h"
// ...
[AdjustIo appDidLaunch:@"{YourAppToken}"];
```

![][delegate]

### 5. Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you successfully integrated
AdjustIo into your app. After the app launched, you should see the debug log
`Tracked session start`.

![][run]

#### Troubleshooting

- If your build failed because of many duplicate symbols, you were probably
  already using AFNetwork before integrating AdjustIo. Just remove the
  `AdjustIo/AFNetworking` group from your Project Navigator to resolve this
  issue.

- If your build failed with the error `AdjustIo requires ARC`, it looks like
  your project is not using [ARC][arc]. In that case we recommend
  [transitioning your project to use ARC][transition]. If you don't want to
  use ARC, you have to enable ARC for all source files of AdjustIo in the
  target's Build Phases:

    Expand the `Compile Sources` group, select all AdjustIo files (AjustIo,
    AI..., ...+AIAdditions, AF..., ...+AFNetworking) and change the `Compiler
    Flags` to `-fobjc-arc` (Select all and press the `Return` key to change
    all at once).

- If you get errors about `automated __weak references`, you need to update
  your deployment target. In your target's `Summary` tab set the `Deployment
  Target` to `5.0`.

### 6. Adjust Logging

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see by calling
`setLogLevel:` with one of the following parameters:

```objc
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelVerbose]; // enable all logging
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelDebug];   // enable more logging
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelInfo];    // the default
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelWarn];    // disable info logging
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelError];   // disable warnings as well
[AdjustIo setLogLevel:AILogLevelAssert];  // disable errors as well
```

## Additional features

Once you integrated the AdjustIo SDK into your project, you can take advantage
of the following features.

### Add tracking of custom events.

You can tell AdjustIo about every event you want. Suppose you want to track
every tap on a button. You would have to create a new Event Token in your
[dashboard]. Let's say that Event Token is `abc123`. In your button's
`buttonDown` method you could then add the following line to track the click:

```objc
[AdjustIo trackEvent:@"abc123"];
```

You can also register a callback URL for that event in your [dashboard] and we
will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. In that
case you can also put some key-value-pairs in a dictionary and pass it to the
`trackEvent` method. We will then append these named parameters to your
callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL
`http://www.adeven.com/callback` for your event with Event Token `abc123` and
execute the following lines:

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *parameters = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[parameters setObject:@"value" forKey:@"key"];
[parameters setObject:@"bar"   forKey:@"foo"];
[AdjustIo trackEvent:@"abc123" withParameters:parameters];
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

    http://www.adeven.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}`
that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback this
placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current
device. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only
append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an
event, these parameters won't even be read.

### Add tracking of revenue

If your users can generate revenue by clicking on advertisements or making
in-app purchases you can track those revenues. If, for example, a click is
worth one cent, you could make the following call to track that revenue:

```objc
[AdjustIo trackRevenue:1.0];
```

The parameter is supposed to be in cents and will get rounded to one decimal
point. If you want to differentiate between different kinds of revenue you can
get different Event Tokens for each kind. Again, you need to create those Event
Tokens in your [dashboard]. In that case you would make a call like this:

```objc
[AdjustIo trackRevenue:1.0 forEvent:@"abc123"];
```

Again, you can register a callback and provide a dictionary of named
parameters, just like it worked with normal events.

```objc
NSMutableDictionary *parameters = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
[parameters setObject:@"value" forKey:@"key"];
[parameters setObject:@"bar"   forKey:@"foo"];
[AdjustIo trackRevenue:1.0 forEvent:@"abc123" withParameters:parameters];
```

If you want to track In-App Purchases, please make sure to call `trackRevenue`
after `finishTransaction` in `paymentQueue:updatedTransaction` only if the
state changed to `SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased`:

```objc
- (void)paymentQueue:(SKPaymentQueue *)queue updatedTransactions:(NSArray *)transactions {
    for (SKPaymentTransaction *transaction in transactions) {
        switch (transaction.transactionState) {
            case SKPaymentTransactionStatePurchased:
                [self finishTransaction:transaction];
                [AdjustIo trackRevenue:...];
                break;
            // more cases
        }
    }
}
```
